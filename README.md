# RUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL: Sample Application

This is the sample application for the 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Developement with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com)

## What I learned:
* Automated testing allows us to write test suites that drive the developement of new features, allow for confident refactoring and catch regressions.
* How to use the Rails **provide** function to set a different title on each page.
* How to use the **setup** function which is run automatically before every test
* Some browsers don't support HTML5 specially older versions of Internet Explorer so we include JS code known as **'HTML5 shim or shiv'** to   work around the issue. This line of code is located in the **application.html.erb file**
* Sass allows us to: *Refer to Chapter 5, section 5.2.2*
    1. nest our elements
    2. define variables to eliminate duplication and write more expressive code.
