# RUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL: Sample Application

This is the sample application for the 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Developement with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com)

## What I learned:
* Automated testing allows us to write test suites that drive the developement of new features, allow for confident refactoring and catch regressions.
* How to use the Rails provide function to set a different title on each page.
